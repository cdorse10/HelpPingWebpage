		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>
			Currently the average response time is eight minutes and the average response time for a policeman is 18 minutes. Our objective is to reduce these times by implementing a more effecient system that is easier to use. 
		</p>

		<h2>Our goals</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Create a safe envirnmont for the user and responder</li>
			<li>Enhance the ability to transmit data in real time</li>
			<li>Better the relationship between organizations and responders</li>
			<li>Give everyone the knowledge they can always contact a responder</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>How do we do this</h2>

		<p>
			We have designed a phone application that tracks you real time and has a emergency button that you can press if you are ever in danger. There are times where you might not have the ability to talk on the phone to a responder. It will also locate the first responders that are around your location and notify them of what is going on.
